# BERT-Transformer-Model-based-Optimized-Market-Sentimental-Portfolio-Analysis
Utilized BERT Large Language Model to predict market sentiments and trends from news articles / reports
## BERT LLM for Market Sentiment Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

This project leverages the power of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) language model to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles and reports. The goal is to quantify market sentiment, enabling more informed decision-making in risk assessment and portfolio rebalancing processes. Additionally, named entity recognition is employed to identify relevant entities.

### Key Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis with BERT**: The project fine-tunes the pre-trained BERT model on domain-specific financial data using PyTorch and the Hugging Face Transformers library. This approach enhances the accuracy and adaptability of sentiment analysis for the financial domain.

2. **Portfolio Analysis and Forecasting**: Monte Carlo simulation and time-series forecasting techniques are applied using pandas, NumPy, and SciPy. These statistical analyses help forecast portfolio performance and prepare for potential market downturns in an adaptive manner.

3. **Named Entity Recognition**: Named entity recognition is integrated to identify and extract relevant entities from financial texts, providing additional context for sentiment analysis and decision-making.

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/bert-market-sentiment.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bert-market-sentiment`
3. Create a new virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix or Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Prepare your financial news articles or reports in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
2. Fine-tune the BERT model on your domain-specific data by running the `fine_tune.py` script.
3. Use the fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis on new financial texts by running the `sentiment_analysis.py` script.
4. Perform portfolio analysis and forecasting by running the `portfolio_analysis.py` script.
